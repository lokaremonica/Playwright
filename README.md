# Technical Assessment for Forward-Deployed Engineer

## Overview
In this exercise, you'll work with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), a test automation framework, to add three automated tests for a todo application and verify one additional test. You'll be improving tests that were code-generated by Ranger's system for [Ranger TODO](https://qa-todo.ranger.net/).

 Do feel free to use [Playwright Codegen](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen) as a tool in this process. And remember to consider good coding practices and locators when identifying elements in the DOM.

## Your Task
You have 60 minutes to fix, finish, and validate four test scenarios that verify core todo functionality:

- `login.ts`: Log into an existing QA TODO account
- `alphabeticallySorted.ts`: Create 4 new todo items and verify that the items are sorted
- `doneAfterUncomplete.ts`: Verify that a todo marked as done is sorted to the bottom of the list
- `rollTenYahoo.ts`: Roll the dice and verify the user gets a special message when the dice lands on ten

Your objectives are to:

1. Create an account to use for these tests
1. Ensure that the tests are able to complete the objectives
1. Ensure tests run consistently and reliably (at least twice in a row)

Following your independent work, we'll have a brief code review discussion where you'll walk through your implementation and any challenges you encountered. Feel free to use online resources during the assessment.

## Setup

### Requirements
- Node.js v22+
- npm

### Quick Start
